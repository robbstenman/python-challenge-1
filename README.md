# Module 2 Challenge
Interactive ordering system for a food truck created using Python.

This project involves combining several different lessons to create a functioning ordering system for a food truck. The file called menu.py in the repository called python-challenge-1 contains all the information needed to run this project.  

It was very challenging and I spent a lot of time getting assistance during office hours, from other students, using the Xpert Learning Assistant, Tabnine, ChatGPT and when I hit a wall, I used the AskBCS Learning Assistant. I found that using Tabnine helped as it was able to identify the correct variable. Then I was able to go back and better undersand the relationships between the variables.

Moving forward, I know I need to pay more attention to the logic flow using tabs. I spent a lot of time trouble shooting the wrong aspect of my code. It turned out that my tab structure was incorrect, which is what was causing some issues. The other part I need to focus on is being consistent with upper and lower case letters.
